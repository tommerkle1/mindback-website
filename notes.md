Need to think about adding some logic for different instances of mindback (agent)

Thinking logic layer that acts as the channel for mindback.

node.js ideally, comms to rasa through API calls

what should the mindback agent be doing?

channel server, nlu server, nlu action server, core server, db

Thinking about how additional channels might be useful. I think there are multiple ways to interact with a knowledge graph. For example, I have quite a few different apps that i interact with. mostly through the browser. Shouldn't I be able to create custom channels? linked to documents across the web? README.md(s), random articles, links, blocks of text I find.

Collection -> organization / management -> search -> insights & automation

Also thinking that not everything needs to be facilitated by NLU. This might be a longer term bet. I think simple user defined commands, with NLU fuzziness might suffice. mindback-shell

Wonder if robot branding might be not the best thing to start with. maybe start just using system etc.

What are some interesting questions when consdering how mindback will be important.

- The ways humans interact with information, computers and automation is not ideal.
- why has there been stagnation in human / machine interaction?
- why have business models emerged that cause poor incentives?
- how will a movement toward decentralization and crypto affect edge ML and personal computing?
- is there a better way to enable comparative advantage between humans and machines?
- what does it mean to own your personal data?
- what is a human os?
- why will b2b automation not get us to arep?
- what are the hidden costs of not being able to leverage your personal data?

- knowledge graph
- multi-channel interface
- personal data collection / management
- personal search engine
  - query language for personal information
- personal automation

what are some interesting queries?

how much money do i have?
did i get paid?

authentication... i think it'd be cool to auth via metamask!

create interface for content publishing, focus, data management

## 5/23/21

i think the purpose of this is information collection, organization, and then mapping it to channels where the info might be useful.

input manage act

- random ideas -> organized -> push somewhere
- health data
- ...personal data

conditional data flow
